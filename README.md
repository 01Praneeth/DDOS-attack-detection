# DDOS-attack-detection
DDoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning is a project that applies various ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.) to detect and classify DDoS attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). It utilizes a cleaned dataset, feature selection techniques, and real-time classification for robust network security.
